# IM:RP Warehouse Bot to track metal and lead

## **The bot is provided as is; the code needs to be modified to adapt to your environment as I hardcoded most things. I will not provide support under any circumstances. Do not reach out to me.**

In order to get started I recommend renting a VPS or setting up some sort of a machine that can run 24/7 along with your distribution of choice.

I personally use Debian 12, but it will work with any other Linux (and maybe even BSD) distribution.

Create a Python virtual environment using this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/

Fetch the requirements with

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Afterwards edit the .env with your credentials and start it up.

As to how to register a Discord bot - Use a search engine to find out.

Additionally, your account needs to be tier 2 in a faction and have the warehouse management fauthority.

### While this is the first and final release of this software, I encourage pull requests and forks and will review them if any are provided.
